London (CNN)Queen Elizabeth II has described being left with a "huge void in her life" after her husband Prince Philip's death, their son Prince Andrew said Sunday.

Speaking to media after attending a service at the chapel at Royal Lodge Windsor, the Duke of York said: "I feel very sorry and supportive of my mother who is feeling it probably more than anybody else."
Philip, the lifelong companion of the Queen and the longest-serving consort in British history, died at the age of 99 on Friday. His body will lie at Windsor Castle until his funeral on Saturday.
"He was a remarkable man, I loved him as a father. He was so calm. If you had a problem he would think about it," Andrew said. "He was always someone you could go to."

The news of Philip's death was met with an outpouring of tributes from around the world, including messages from every living US President and other world leaders.
The royal family themselves are "all feeling a great sense of loss," Andrew said. "We've lost almost the grandfather of the nation."
Asked how his mother is feeling, the duke replied: "The Queen as you would expect is an incredibly stoic person. And she described his passing as a miracle. And she's contemplating.
"She described it as having left a huge void in her life," he said, adding that the family is "rallying around to make sure that we're there to support her."
